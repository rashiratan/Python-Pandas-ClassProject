This project is to demonstrate my ability to perform data analysis using business scenarios using Pandas. Here are the skills demonstrated in this notebook:

Import and create Pandas DataFrames from dictionaries and lists.
Identify and handle missing data.
Transform data by adding calculated columns and renaming columns.
Filter and index data using boolean expressions and string methods.
Group data and perform multiple aggregations.
Merge DataFrames and create pivot tables.
Save and load data using CSV and Excel formats.
Communicate your data analysis findings in a clear, concise report.
